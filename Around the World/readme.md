# Around the World NFC Exhibit
In 1936, Herbet Ekins flew around the world flying only on commercially operated flights. This interactive exhibit gives visitors a better understanding of this first-in-history journey that took 18 days. My job as an intern was to replace the old hydraulic and counter-weights system that was powering the exhibit in the past. This system had stopped working many years ago due to it's mechanical complexity. This was by far the most complicated exhibit I designed and built during my internship.
