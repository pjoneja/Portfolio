# Expanding Space mechanical exhibit
An interactive exhibit intended to show how the expansion of the universe means the space between galaxies expands/distance between galaxies increases. Built using a bicycle mechanism, and spring to return to original position, with foam-core galaxies painted flourescent green glued to black spandex. Our job as interns was to replace the white LEDs with 400nm, near ultraviolet LEDS that would make the galaxies "glow" as the original design, as well as to perform a maintenance overhaul to worn out pieces. No programmable electronics here!
