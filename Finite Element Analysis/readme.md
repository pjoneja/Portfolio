# "StopBot", Autonomous Mobile Robot
Learning to use FEA software (ANSYS) to solve structural and thermal engineering problems. The final project was to use FEA as a design tool in cooking a turkey. The simulations takes into account material properties of food like turkey, duck, chicken, stuffing as well as phase changes during the oven cooking process. The cooking procedure involves choosing conductive and convective boundary conditions to optimize the trade-off between faster cooking time and minimal burned volume.

The final paper provides documentation of the design process, including material properties, boundary conditions, meshing, assessing mesh quality, results, verification with hand-calculations, and evaluation of results.
