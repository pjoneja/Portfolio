# Portfolio
The subheadings below list examples of projects I've worked on. Many of these include code written by me with comments explaining the motivation. The purpose of this portfolio is to

1. show the range of work I've done and variety of languages/tools I've worked with;
2. document the thoughts and attitudes I have while building a project; and above all,
3. keep track of what I have learned either by reading documentation, searching online forums like StackOverflow etc. or from peers and mentors. 

This portfolio is not about showing some clever hacks. It's about displaying the work I'm proud of at my current skill-level. I know I will continute to learn a lot more as I gain experience and I'm committed to adding to this repertoire. 

Check the description files in each folder for a deeper explanation.

Lastly, I wish I had taken photos that are 'prettier'. Unfortunately, the labs/workshop spaces where beautiful things are made aren't always pretty themselves.

## Racing Wheelchair for Backwards Bill, Senior Capstone Project, Achilles International/The Cooper Union
*(This project is currently in-progress)*

"Backwards" Bill Reilly is a marathon athlete with Cerebral Palsy - a neurological disorder that limits muscle coordination. His disability means he runs long distances by sitting in a customized wheelchair that faces backwards and uses his feet to propel himself by pushing on the ground. In a race like the New York City Marathon or Boston Marathon, Bill relies on at least four guides to run with him.

Bill's current racing wheelchair has no brakes and no steering, which is not safe for both Bill and his guides. To slow him down, two guides push down on each side of Bill's chair. To steer, the guides need to lift and drag to redirect Bill's chair. This is especially dangerous for sharp turns right after a downhill, when guides are clearing a path through the crowd for Bill to pass. The guides risk getting run over by a chair that is difficult to control.

Throughout the design process, we are mindful that every person in Team Bill has physical and social needs that must be addressed by any proposed solutions. First, we will design mechanisms that make it possible for both Bill and his guides to steer and brake the wheelchair safely. We will also design an improved seat belt and a customized shoe to fit Bill's unique running style.

## Fully-Automated Espresso Machine, Machine Design, The Cooper Union
A machine designed and manufactured from scratch to brew coffee from bean to cup. It is capable of freshly grinding whole coffee beans, packing/pressurizing the brewing chamber with a piston and delivering high-quality coffee to the cup. We have prototyped the individual mechanisms, engineered the closed-loop controls, and are moving on to manufacturing the final machine using food-safe engineering materials like stainless steel, polyethylene (HDPE) and nylon.

## "StopBot", Autonomous Mobile Robot, The Cooper Union
StopBot won first place and set a university "world record" in the annual autonomous robot competition. StopBot is designed to detect enemy robots and shoot a ping pong ball, while safely navigating the arena by planning a path to avoid all obstacles. The robot is built using machined nylon, laser cut acrylic,

## Physics Simulations, The Cooper Union
A project-based class that took a deep dive into algorithms. Topics covered included numerical integration, computing derivatives, solving ODEs with higher-order Runge-Kutta methods, optimization algorithms, Fourier transforms. 

[My final project](https://github.com/pjoneja/TippeTop) was a visual simulation of a special kind of spinning top called a [*tippe top*](https://github.com/pjoneja/TippeTop). The [paper](https://github.com/pjoneja/TippeTop/blob/master/Joneja-TippeTop.pdf) I wrote proved that the simulation followed physical laws of conservation of angular momentum and energy while minimizing computational error.

All projects in Python. Read about [all the other projects in the folder here](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Physics%20Simulations)

## Exhibit Technology / Mechanical Engineering Intern at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. 

A collection of projects I worked on while interning at the Air and Space museum. Project files are saved in individual folders; project descriptions are listed below.

### [Moon-to-Earth at light speed exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Moon-to-Earth)
An interactive exhibit showing how long it takes light to travel from the moon to the earth (~1.3 seconds). Built using 28 solid state relays, two 16-output decoders, a bank of LEDs and an Arduino. Written in C/C++. View in person at the Air and Space Museum in D.C.

### [Capacitive Touch Keyboard Piano exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Capacitive%20Touch%20Piano)
An interactive exhibit intended to show that the visibile portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is analogous to one octave on a piano. Built using an MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor and a VS1053 Music Player Shield w/ microSD Card, both from Adafruit, as well as an Arduino. View in person at the Air and Space Museum in D.C.

### [Timeline of Jet Aviation Video Selector exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Timeline%20of%20Jet%20Aviation)
An interactive video selector. Visitors press numbered buttons to select videos from a large video catalogue. The videos depict the advances in design and technology of jet-powered aircraft, from early, prototypical jets like the Bell XP-59A to a variety of specialized, modern jets like the Lockheed SR-71 and the Airbus A300. The exhibit has a simple design on the surface, but like everything else at the museum, it was necessary to take many more details into account while designing the user interface.

### [Expanding Space mechanical exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Expanding%20Space)
An interactive exhibit intended to show how the expansion of the universe means the space between galaxies expands/distance between galaxies increases. Built using a bicycle mechanism, and spring to return to original position, with foam-core galaxies painted flourescent green glued to black spandex. Our job as interns was to replace the white LEDs with 400nm, near ultraviolet LEDS that would make the galaxies "glow" as the original design, as well as to perform a maintenance overhaul to worn out pieces. No programmable electronics here!

### [Pixelator live video camera exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Pixelator)
An interactive camera exhibit that demonstrates the concept of pixels and camera resolution. In the context of the the 'Looking at Earth' gallery, this exhibit illustrates how early earth-facing satellites were limited by low resolution, while newer ones can see much greater detail due to advances in camera resolution. The exhibit greatly simplifies the concept, and puts the user in control so that one can understand and interact with the idea of pixels and resolution.

### [Around the World in 18 days NFC exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Around%20the%20World)
In 1936, Herbet Ekins flew around the world flying only on commercially operated flights. This interactive exhibit gives visitors a better understanding of this first-in-history journey that took 18 days. My job as an intern was to replace the old hydraulic and counter-weights system that was powering the exhibit in the past. This system had stopped working many years ago due to it's mechanical complexity. This was by far the most complicated exhibit I designed and built during my internship.
