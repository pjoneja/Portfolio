# Portfolio
The subheadings below list examples of projects I've worked on. Many of these include code written by me with comments explaining the motivation. The purpose of this portfolio is to

1. show the range of work I've done and variety of languages/tools I've worked with;
2. document the thoughts and attitudes I have while building a project; and above all,
3. keep track of what I have learned either by reading documentation, searching online forums like StackOverflow etc. or from peers and mentors. 

This portfolio is not about showing some clever hacks. It's about displaying the work I'm proud of at my current skill-level. I know I will continute to learn a lot more as I gain experience and I'm committed to adding to this repertoire. 

Check the description files in each folder for a deeper explanation.

Lastly, I wish I had taken photos that are 'prettier'. Unfortunately, the labs/workshop spaces where beautiful things are made aren't always pretty themselves.

## Research & Development Engineering Intern at Universal Creative, Universal Parks & Resorts worldwide
Due to non-disclosure agreements I have signed, I am not able to write any specifics of what I worked on. 

What I can say:
- Designed an ultra-lightweight robot with carbon fiber components to meet specific requirements
- Collaborated closely with machinists and specialized vendors to fabricate precision parts
- Rapidly iterated the design 5 times after reviews with 2 Sr. Engineers and Director of Show Systems 
- Prototyped a low-cost animatronic figure and fabricated an automated test rig to study durability
- Presented my dept’s work at a company-wide “Demo Day” involving designers and marketing teams

## Automation Engineering Intern at Energy Metrics, New York, NY
Again, due to specific NDAs, all I can say:
- Tested and programmed RESTful API in C# to integrate commercial IoT devices to Energy Metrics’ core product
- Participated in frequent code reviews to implement programming design patterns to improve code reusability
- Initiated research and designed first machine learning pipeline to learn energy usage from user behavior data
- Independently presented research to company president and VPs of Engineering and Product

## Physics Simulations
A project-based class that took a deep dive into algorithms. Topics covered included numerical integration, computing derivatives, solving ODEs with higher-order Runge-Kutta methods, optimization algorithms, Fourier transforms. 

[My final project](https://github.com/pjoneja/TippeTop) was a visual simulation of a special kind of spinning top called a [*tippe top*](https://github.com/pjoneja/TippeTop). The [paper](https://github.com/pjoneja/TippeTop/blob/master/Joneja-TippeTop.pdf) I wrote proved that the code I wrote followed physical laws of conservation of angular momentum and energy while minimizing error.

All projects in Python. Read about [all the other projects in the folder here](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Physics%20Simulations)

## Exhibit Technology / Mechanical Engineering Intern at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. 

A collection of projects I worked on while interning at the Air and Space museum. Project files are saved in individual folders; project descriptions are listed below.

### [Moon-to-Earth at light speed exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Moon-to-Earth)
An interactive exhibit showing how long it takes light to travel from the moon to the earth (~1.3 seconds). Built using 28 solid state relays, two 16-output decoders, a bank of LEDs and an Arduino. Written in C/C++. View in person at the Air and Space Museum in D.C.

### [Capacitive Touch Keyboard Piano exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Capacitive%20Touch%20Piano)
An interactive exhibit intended to show that the visibile portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is analogous to one octave on a piano. Built using an MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor and a VS1053 Music Player Shield w/ microSD Card, both from Adafruit, as well as an Arduino. View in person at the Air and Space Museum in D.C.

### [Timeline of Jet Aviation Video Selector exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Timeline%20of%20Jet%20Aviation)
An interactive video selector. Visitors press numbered buttons to select videos from a large video catalogue. The videos depict the advances in design and technology of jet-powered aircraft, from early, prototypical jets like the Bell XP-59A to a variety of specialized, modern jets like the Lockheed SR-71 and the Airbus A300. The exhibit has a simple design on the surface, but like everything else at the museum, it was necessary to take many more details into account while designing the user interface.

### [Expanding Space mechanical exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Expanding%20Space)
An interactive exhibit intended to show how the expansion of the universe means the space between galaxies expands/distance between galaxies increases. Built using a bicycle mechanism, and spring to return to original position, with foam-core galaxies painted flourescent green glued to black spandex. Our job as interns was to replace the white LEDs with 400nm, near ultraviolet LEDS that would make the galaxies "glow" as the original design, as well as to perform a maintenance overhaul to worn out pieces. No programmable electronics here!

### [Pixelator live video camera exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Pixelator)
An interactive camera exhibit that demonstrates the concept of pixels and camera resolution. In the context of the the 'Looking at Earth' gallery, this exhibit illustrates how early earth-facing satellites were limited by low resolution, while newer ones can see much greater detail due to advances in camera resolution. The exhibit greatly simplifies the concept, and puts the user in control so that one can understand and interact with the idea of pixels and resolution.

### [Around the World in 18 days NFC exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Around%20the%20World)
In 1936, Herbet Ekins flew around the world flying only on commercially operated flights. This interactive exhibit gives visitors a better understanding of this first-in-history journey that took 18 days. My job as an intern was to replace the old hydraulic and counter-weights system that was powering the exhibit in the past. This system had stopped working many years ago due to it's mechanical complexity. This was by far the most complicated exhibit I designed and built during my internship.

## Interactive and Responsive Website for Interscholastic Association of Southeast Asian Schools (IASAS)

### [Win/Loss Tables](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Data%20Tables)
A borrowed/adapted implementation of an HTML data table that leverages the power and ease-of-use of Google Spreadsheets. My implementation uses JSON, JavaScript, HTML Tables and Google Spreadsheets. View online [here](http://iasas.jisedu.or.id/basketball/standings.html). Note: Link may not work during academic holidays.

### [Poll-ster](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Poll-ster)
A hacked-together implementation of an online audience poll using Google Spreadsheets, JSON, JavaScript and HTML Tables. 
View online [here](http://iasas.jisedu.or.id/basketball/fans.html). Note: Link may not work during academic holidays.

### [Messages Box](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Fan%20Messages)
A hacked-together implementation of an public comment box using Google Forms, JSON, JavaScript and HTML Tables. May not be as 'pretty' as Disqus/other comment box implementations, but this solutions allows for full administrative control over what gets posted.
