# Portfolio
The subheadings below list examples of projects I've worked on, especially containting code written by me, with comments explaining the motivation. The purpose of this portfolio is to

1. show the range of work I've done and variety of languages/tools I've worked with;
2. document the thoughts and attitudes I have while building a project; and above all,
3. keep track of what I have learned either by reading documentation, searching online forums like StackOverflow etc. or from peers and mentors. 

This portfolio is not about showing some clever hacks (most 'cuz they probably aren't that clever to begin with). It's about displaying the work I'm proud of at my current skill-level. I know I will continute to learn a lot more as I gain experience and I'm committed to adding to this repertoire. 

Check the description files in each folder for a deeper explanation.

### Poll-ster
A hacked-together implementation of an online audience poll using Google Spreadsheets, JSON, JavaScript and HTML Tables.

### Messages Box
A hacked-together implementation of an public comment box using Google Forms, JSON, JavaScript and HTML Tables. May not be as 'pretty' as Disqus/other comment box implementations, but this solutions allows for full administrative control over what gets posted.

### Data Tables
A borrowed/adapted implementation of an HTML data table that leverages the power and ease-of-use of Google Spreadsheets. My implementation uses JSON, JavaScript, HTML Tables and Google Spreadsheets.

## Exhibit Technology Intern at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. 

A collection of projects I worked on while interning at the Air and Space museum. Project files are saved in individual folders; project descriptions are listed below.

### [Moon-to-Earth at light speed exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Moon-to-Earth)
An interactive exhibit showing how long it takes light to travel from the moon to the earth (~1.3 seconds). Built using 28 solid state relays, two 16-output decoders, a bank of LEDs and an Arduino. Written in C/C++. View in person at the Air and Space Museum in D.C.

### [Capacitive Touch Keyboard Piano exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Capacitive%20Touch%20Piano)
An interactive exhibit intended to show that the visibile portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is analogous to one octave on a piano. Built using an MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor and a VS1053 Music Player Shield w/ microSD Card, both from Adafruit, as well as an Arduino. View in person at the Air and Space Museum in D.C.

### [Timeline of Jet Aviation Video Selector exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Timeline%20of%20Jet%20Aviation)
An interactive video selector. Visitors press numbered buttons to select videos from a large video catalogue. The videos depict the advances in design and technology of jet-powered aircraft, from early, prototypical jets like the Bell XP-59A to a variety of specialized, modern jets like the Lockheed SR-71 and the Airbus A300. The exhibit has a simple design on the surface, but like everything else at the museum, it was necessary to take many more details into account while designing the user interface.

### [Expanding Space mechanical exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio#expanding-space-mechanical-exhibit)
An interactive exhibit intended to show how the expansion of the universe means the space between galaxies expands/distance between galaxies increases. Built using a bicycle mechanism, and spring to return to original position, with foam-core galaxies painted flourescent green glued to black spandex. Our job as interns was to replace the white LEDs with 400nm, near ultraviolet LEDS that would make the galaxies "glow" as the original design, as well as to perform a maintenance overhaul to worn out pieces. No programmable electronics here!

### [Pixelator live video camera exhibit](https://github.com/pjoneja/Portfolio/tree/master/Pixelator)

### Around the World in 18 days NFC exhibit
