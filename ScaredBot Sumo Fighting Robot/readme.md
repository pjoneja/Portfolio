# "ScaredBot", Sumo Fighting Robot
ScaredBot won second place in Cooper Union's annual sumo robot competition. ScaredBot dominates in a fight by physically pushing opponent robots out of the arena. As such, ScaredBot's design includes high-torque motors, large grippy wheels and a two-pronged ramp on the front. Infrared sensors allow ScaredBot to sense the edges of the arena so it does not drive itself out, thus losing the match. The code is written in C using a library to call specific opcodes in the programmable integrated circuit (PIC) documentation provided by the manufacturer.
