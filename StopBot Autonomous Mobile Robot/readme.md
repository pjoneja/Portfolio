# "StopBot", Autonomous Mobile Robot
StopBot won first place and set a university "world record" in the annual autonomous robot competition. StopBot is designed to detect enemy robots and shoot a ping pong ball, while safely navigating the arena by planning a path to avoid all obstacles. The robot is built using machined acetal delrin and laser cut acrylic. It operates using infrared distance sensors, phototransistors and an Arduino Mega. The code is organized in a hierarchy to prioritize small subtasks in order to achieve the overall goal. In robotics vocabulary, this is known as hierarchal subsumption code architecture.
