# "StopBot", Autonomous Mobile Robot
StopBot won first place and set a university "world record" in the annual autonomous robot competition. StopBot is designed to detect enemy robots and shoot a ping pong ball, while safely navigating the arena by planning a path to avoid all obstacles. The robot is built using machined acetal delrin and laser cut acrylic and operates using infrared distance sensors, phototransistors and an Arduino Mega.
